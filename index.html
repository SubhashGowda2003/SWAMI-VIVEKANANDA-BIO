                <h2>A Short Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Swami Vivekananda</b> (12 January 1863 â€“ 4 July 1902),
                    born Narendranath Datta[b] was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher,
                    and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the
                    introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. He is credited with
                    raising interfaith awareness and bringing Hinduism to the status of
                    a major world religion in the late nineteenth century.[9] Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha
                    family
                    in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion and spirituality. At the age
                    of 18
                    he met Ramakrishna, later becoming a devoted
                    follower and sannyasin (renunciate). After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda toured the Indian
                    subcontinent
                    as a wandering monk and acquired first-hand knowledge of the often terrible living conditions of
                    Indian people in
                    then British India. In 1893 he traveled to the United States where he participated in the Parliament
                    of Religions in Chicago.
